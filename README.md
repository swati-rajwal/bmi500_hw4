## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èRunning the Analysis
1. The `hw4.py` is the main script containing all the code
2. The resultant figures are stored in `output/` directory. The code will create one if not available already.
3. Command to run the code: `python hw4.py`.
4. [Optional] I prefer to store my terminal results in a txt file for future reference. One can do so by running `python hw4.py | tee  output/output.txt`. The txt file will be stored in the `output/` directory as specified in the command.
